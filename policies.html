	<p><b>Details…</b></p>
	<p><b><a name="grading">Grading</a></b></p>
	<p>Grading in Digital Media Communication will use a point system. The following list shows how much each assignment type is worth:</p>
	<ul><li>Classwork/Homework - 20%</li>
	<li>Assessments - 30%</li>
	<li>Projects - 50%</li></ul>
	<p>Extra credit work will sometimes be available at teacher discretion.</p>
	<p><b><a name="latework">Late Work</a></b></p>
	<ol><li>If you would like to hand something in late, you must first fill out the&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/natickps.org/internet-management/forms-1/late-work">Late Work Form</a>&nbsp;on your class’s website.</li>
	<li>Assignments not completed at all will receive a grade of zero.</li>
	<li>The maximum grade for a late assignment will be reduced by one letter for every two days the assignment is late. An assignment that is two or fewer days late will&nbsp;receive&nbsp;a maximum grade of B (85), an assignment that is three or more days late will receive a maximum grade of C (75).</li>
	</ol>
	<p><b><a name="cellpolicy">Mr. Lipson’s Cell Phone Policy</a></b></p>
	<p>As described in the school handbook, students are not allowed to use their cell phones in the academic wings. Student phones must be turned off or set to silent at all times, and must be kept inside your bag or backpack.</p>
	<p>During the last&nbsp;<b>two minutes</b>&nbsp;of the class period, you may remove your cell phone or other allowed device from your bag to enter items into a calendar, to-do list or other productivity application. You&nbsp;<b>MAY NOT</b>&nbsp;make phone calls, send text messages, browse the internet or use unapproved applications. Students who make calls, send texts, etc. will be subject to the normal consequences for using cell phones in class (detention, parent calls, suspension, etc). Before you leave the classroom, you must&nbsp;<b>put the phone away</b>. If you’re caught in the hallway with your phone, the normal rules apply.</p>
	<p>I use my cell phone as an organizer, and I encourage you to do so too. You will sometimes see me take it out during class to add items to a calendar or to-do list. I will not make or respond to phone calls or text messages during class. If you have any questions about this policy, or you’re interested in some information about how to stay organized using your cell phone or other device, please see me after class or feel free to email me at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:mlipson@natickps.org">mlipson@natickps.org</a>.</p>
	<p><b><a name="attendance">Attendance/Tardiness</a></b></p>
	<p><b>Don’t skip class.</b>&nbsp;If your absence is&nbsp;<b>unexcused</b>, you will be referred to the main office for discipline and will miss your chance to be graded for any work you were responsible for that day. If your absence is&nbsp;<b>excused</b>, you’re fine - come and see me outside of class to make up your work for full credit.</p>
	<p><b>Don’t be late to class.</b>&nbsp;When class begins, I will close the door. If you arrive late, wait outside until I let you in. If you are let in late&nbsp;<b>without a pass</b>, you must serve a 20-minute after-school teacher detention&nbsp;within&nbsp;the next week. If you arrive late&nbsp;<b>with a pass</b>, you’re fine. Just come in and begin working.</p>
	<p><b><a name="equipment">Classroom Equipment</a></b></p>
	<p>1.&nbsp;Be careful with the equipment. If something breaks, let me know as soon as possible so I can get it fixed.</p>
	<p>2. Keep your hands to yourself: do not touch other students or the equipment they’re using. This includes computers, mice and keyboards, microphones and other devices. It also includes other students’ files, whether they’re on another computer or your own.</p>
	<p>3. Students are expected to provide their own headphones (except in Electronic Music). If you’re unable to bring your own headphones, I have a limited set of headphones that you can borrow.</p>
	<p><b><a name="otherrules">Other Classroom Rules</a></b></p>
	<ol><li><b>No food or drink</b>&nbsp;is allowed in the room – finish it outside.</li>
	<li>Focus on your work. Students who avoid work with video games and other distractions will lose their ability to connect to the internet.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Be respectful of others. Leave negative comments at the door.</li>
	<li>Use school-appropriate language, please.</li>
	<li>A109 is going&nbsp;<b>paperless</b>&nbsp;this year. Please send an email or instant message instead of printing.</li>
	</ol>
	<div><a name="spelling&quot;"><b>Spelling, Grammar, Punctuation and Content</b></a></div>
	<div><br>
	</div>
	<div>You are expected to use spelling, grammar and punctuation correctly in any assignment that involves text. You should always answer questions in your own words, and always use complete sentences. Points will be taken off for incorrect spelling, bad grammar, incorrect punctuation and incomplete sentences.&nbsp;</div>
	<div><br>
	</div>
	<div><a name="plagiarism"><b>Plagiarism</b></a></div>
	<div><br>
	</div>
	<div>Plagiarism is absolutely not tolerated. All assignments, including short worksheets, must be written in your own words. Copying and pasting from a website is considered plagiarism and will result in a grade of zero.</div>
	<div><br>
	</div>
	<div><b><a name="data">Personal Data</a></b></div>
	<div><br>
	</div>
	<div>Get a flash drive and bring it to class every day. Keep backup copies of your work on it. It is also a good idea to keep a second backup in an online storage service such as Dropbox or Box.net. Unpredictable things happen with computer hard drives, and it is possible that your data could be lost. Having a backup protects you in case things go awry.</div>
